		<h1> Data Report</h1>

		<h3>Some Definitions for Interpreting the Report:</h3>
		<h4>Beat:</h4>
		<p>According to Seattle's government web page, the description of the Beats are as follows. Seattle is divided into five geographic areas. Within those areas are the 5 precincts or police stations: North, East, South, West and Southwest. Precinct boundaries were determined through consideration of neighborhood boundaries, geographic and other natural boundaries.Each precinct contains smaller geographic areas called Sectors. There are 17 sectors total in the city.Each of these Sectors are divided into between 3 smaller sections called Beats (i.e. Ocean sector has three beats O1, O2, O3) These are the areas that individual patrol officers are assigned responsibility for.</p>

			<h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class='header'>Mitchell Petellin and Andrew Millan</p>
			<br>
			<p>This webpage has the journal entries of Mitchell Petellin and Andrew Millan. The journal entries are on one page, while the report of the data is on another. The data was gathered from the Seattle Government website as well as the National Centers for Environmental Information webstie. During our investigation, we added the city of St. Paul and its weather to our report so that we could compare the two cities in addition to the weather in St. Paul being significantly different than the weather in Seattle.</p>
			<br>
			
				<ul>
				During the report we look to answer the following questions:
					<li>While comparing the two cities, how does weather play an effect into the crimerates throughout different times of the year?</li>
					<li>How do the two cities compare or differ with their crime in certain areas of the city?</li>
					<li>What are some of the similar times of day that crimes occur and is this consistent between the Midwest State and the Pacific Northwest State?</li>
				</ul>
			
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p> There are roughly five hundred thousand unique data points in the crime dataset and about four thousand points in the weather dataset for the Seattle data set. For the St. Paul data set, there were about one hundred and sixty thousand data points for crime and a little more than three thousand points for the St. Paul weather data set. The Seattle crime dataset consists of crimes recorded from 2008 until the present day when we first downloaded the data. The weather dataset is the weather everyday to the present, starting in January of 2008. The St. Paul crimes data starts in 2010 and goes until present day while the weather daata starts at the beginning of August 2014 until the present. For our direct comparisons between the two cities, we would look at the summers and winters of both respectively where there was data timestamps that overlapped. That way we would be doing a direct comparison for both cities.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Once we got all the data together, we were able to merge the respective weather and city data sets together. Because we started with only Seattle and its weather, we we did not combine all four data sets together. We did two seperate notebooks for each city but within each notebook we combined the two together so each weather day was matched up with the day of the crime. This allowed for our analysis to be percise when looking at the weather for given days and during the months when the crime was occuring. </p>

			<h3>HEAT MAPS</h3>

			<figure><img src="images/charts/heatmap.png"></figure>
			<figure><img src="images/charts/stPaul_heatmap.png"></figure>
			<p>This chart takes the crime count for the day and the weather for the day during the year 2014. There aer two Y-axis' and the X-axis is the day throughout the year starting with January 1st as day 1. The orange line is the temperature and the blue line is the count of crime for that day. Looking at the graph, it seems that in 2014 during the hottest part of the year the amount of crime goes down. Other notable moments in 2014 when the crime was low is during the winter months and times when the temperature had a warm spike or cold spike. On the contrary, moments when the crime was high is during the spring and fall when the weather is not too warm or too cold. Crime seems to be at its peak when crime is around 55 degrees fahrenheit.</p>

			<h3>Fourth Graph</h3>

			<h5>above seattle: below st paul</h5>
			<figure><img src="images/charts/2015_Summer.png"></figure>
			<figure><img src="images/charts/2015_Winter.png"></figure>
			<p>And continuing on from the previous graph, this one is for the temperature of 60 degrees fahrenheit and over. So contrary to the previous graph, this one we are expecting there to more crimes that occur outdoors. Looking back at the 30 degrees and under bar chart, the Robbery-Street is an example subcategory that increases when it is warmer out. In addition, the subcategory Theft-Bicycle increases significantly as expected because more bikes will be out during the warmer days of the year. It can be seen that the majority of crime increases in the 60 degrees and over chart because there are more days with this kind of weather but it can also reflect the more common type of crime when the weather becomes colder. With less days to commit crimes for being below 30 degrees, the bar charts can show during those few days, what is the most common type of crime. Also, looking at the subcategories against eachother, Car Prowl year round regardless of the weather is much larger than any other category of crime. That said, it is always a good idea to lock your car and keep vaulables hidden or kept out of the car.</p>

			<h3>WEATHER</h3>

			<h5>above is seattle : below is st paul</h5>
			<figure><img src="images/charts/st.paul_summer.png"></figure>
			<figure><img src="images/charts/st.paul_winter.png"></figure>
			<p>This heat map can be tough to understand but there is some information here that can be of use. For starters, the X-axis is each day of the year and the interval is every 30 days or roughly a month. The y-axis is the occurred time that the crime was reported. </p>
